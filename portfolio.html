      A little sum-up for 2024. We managed to port all three mainstream 3D generative AI paradigms in MindSpore! 
      <br>
      Beyond that we have been working on multi-modal world foundation model design, and I was glad to be invited back to HKUST SENG earlier in Spring 2025 to talk about this amazing topic!

      I am thrilled to join Huawei HKRC AI Lab in 2024, working on generative AI for 3D assets. The 3D video here you are seeing of a cute cat rooting for Huawei MindSpore is built purely upon the native <a href="https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/design/overview.html">MindSpore framework</a> from a simple text prompt input. Let's democratize AI for all mankind!

      I successfully defended my PhD thesis in January 2024. It has been an incredible ride for me and I really appreciate Prof. Yue's precious guidance and support along the way. I will be working on AIGC projects like LLMs and multi-modality generation in the industry for the next.

      Just before my PhD defense, I was honored to receive the "ECE Future Leaders" award from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE), HKUST in December 2023. The certificate serves as a recognition of my potential and leadership qualities in the field of 3D visual perception in AI.

      Voila! Our work, CDRNet, has been published in <a href="https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/">ICCV 2023 workshops</a>. From Oct. 2-6, 2023, I was excited to present our CDRNet poster at the workshops here in Paris.

        In 2023, I have developed a new algorithm dubbed <a href="https://hafred.github.io/cdrnet/">CDRNet</a> for vision-based 3D reconstruction. The QoS of this work can reach the criteria for real-time robotic applications, such as requesting a robot to walk around in the warehouse and grab goods from the shelf.

        I do play basketball for a long time. Here is <a href="https://www.hk01.com/Jumper/360756">one of my post-game interview reports</a> during Jordan Brand Invitational 2019 at <a href="https://en.soustadium.com/">the Southorn Stadium</a>, as I have been playing for HKUST Men's Basketball Team since 2018. I also enjoy photographing and I will release some of my portfolio sometime later.</p>

        Modulated light communication via LED signages and its detection on cellphones can be very versatile in many applications, but sometimes they suffer from luminance defects and bringing in some AI may help. To this end, I developed pixel-wise LED signage brand object detection using an open-source <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_feature_extractor.py">SSD + MobileNetV2 model</a> on the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite">Tensorflow-Lite</a> platform to alleviate this issue. This AI object detection demo was implemented on a low-end Android phone, Samsung Galaxy S4 in real time.
